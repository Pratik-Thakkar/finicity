1. Architect the ideal AWS infrastructure to allow for multi-environment application deployment. The following should be diagramed and a description of the tools and methods you would use to implement the architecture should be described.

* VPC's 
* Subnets
* Security Group Rules
* Route Tables 

1.a) How would you implement this in code? Code examples on github appreciated


2. Create a docker-compose.yml and any needed Docker files to show a Django "Hello World" application.

* Pushed to public repo in Github 
* Uses Postgres as database 
* Uses Redis as cache for Django app 


3. Outline a tool that harvests the name, instance type, and availability zone from a group of AWS accounts. 

* High-level description of the code
* How would you handle a large number of AWS accounts?
* What would you leverage to gather information?
* What would you rely on to store and visualize or monitor those numbers?
